1)  Several Robocode properties has to be changed in order for Perceptron to work well.
    Robocode properties are located at robocode/config/robocode.properties file.

    1.1) robocode.robot.filesystem.quota=1000000000
            This property is a max available disk space that robot can use, measured in bytes. I.e. the total size of all files
            located under the robot data directory, which is '<ROBOT_NAME>.data' folder located near the robot class.
            Default value is 200000, i.e. 200 Kb. The new value is 1 Gb. At most I used 500 000 serialized objects
            each about 1 Kb, so I set 1 Gb to be sure everything is fine.
    1.2) robocode.cpu.constant=20000000
            Maximum time for a robot to complete a turn, measured in nanoseconds. Default value depends on the machine CPU,
            for my machine it was 6000000 nanoseconds, or 6 milliseconds. The new value is 20 milliseconds.
            If robot thread blocks for more than that time, it is considered as skipping turns. If robot skips too many turns
            in a row it is disabled and looses a round. Generally Perceptron performs good with the default value, but about
            once per 150 000 rounds it looses a round because of "too many turns skipped". Presumably that happens because
            of the garbage collection and it is a known Robocode issue.

2)  Update application rendering and view preferences for speed. TODO document what exactly to do - modify via config file

3)  First enemy is VelociRobot.

4)  Testing of optimal matrixMaxAbsWeight values.
    Battle results with 10000 rounds, random matrices and different matrixMaxAbsWeight values.

    matrixMaxAbsWeight,     winPercentage
    1,                      16.75%
    10,                     6.99%
    100,                    5.56%
    1000,                   5.57%
    10000,                  5.57%
