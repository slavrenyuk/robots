1. Update training - add ability to get some amount of survivors from file and save them as just weight matrices to another file
    Fighting mode must be also updated to use weight matrices instead of scored weight matrices.

2. Fighting with VelociRobot still shows 92% wins and 84% Robocode score. Consider even more rigorous scoring of the latest
    survivors and choose only some of them with better values.


TECH DEBT

1. add javadocs

2. add project description to README file
