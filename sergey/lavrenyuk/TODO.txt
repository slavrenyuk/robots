1. add javadocs

2. add project description to README file

3. add logs to trainer and scorer

4. implement code to examine survivals file (e.g. show win ratio) and decide what survivors should go to a final file to be
        used in fighting mode

5. implement fighting mode (? use different name ?)

6. survivors file is used as a backup file, but there is no option to recreate a population basing on survivors file,
        but only on scored weight matrices
        UPD there is an indirect way to do that - copy survivors and use  as scored weight matrices file,
            but that won't work if number of survivors in the file is less than 'survivors' config property

7. Test different robocode.cpu.constant. Located in robocode/config/robocode.properties
        The value if measured in nanoseconds, it represents how much time robot can spent for a turn.
        Currently it is 6081774, which is 6 milliseconds. On the other hand, increasing the property may increase execution time.
        E.g., I can try 20 milliseconds, which is 20000000 nanoseconds. If it won't slow down the training,
        I should increase the value to prevent turns skipping because of the garbage collection (presumably).
        Add this info to MEMO.txt once tested and changed.

8. remove scorer.startFileIndex property, it should be possible to find last by index analyzing the data folder
