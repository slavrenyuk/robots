1. add javadocs

2. add project description to README file

3. add logs to trainer

4. implement code to examine survivals file (e.g. show win ratio) and decide what survivors should go to a final file to be
        used in fighting mode

5. implement fighting mode (? use different name ?)

6. survivors file is used as a backup file, but there is no option to recreate a population basing on survivors file,
        but only on scored weight matrices
        UPD there is an indirect way to do that - copy survivors and use  as scored weight matrices file,
            but that won't work if number of survivors in the file is less than 'survivors' config property

7. Bug still occurs (rarely though, about several times during 500 000 rounds)
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Only sequential read / write methods calls are allowed

	what is strange - after that the battle did not ended spamming with that message

    I hope I fixed this, let it be here for now for information.

8. Test what events on win / on death / round ended are triggered when different exceptional situations occurs
testing onDeath / onWin / onRoundEnded
exception in run() - non of the above events triggered
exception in an event handler - non of the above events triggered
too many turns skipped - the same... fuck

Think about robust solution which tolerates no scoring attempts or multiple scoring attempts in a round

I hope I fixed this, let it be here for now for information.

9. Document list of Robocode bugfeatures:
    (1) empty file created if not found
    (2) OnRoundEnded not triggered on exception, presumably both OnDeath and OnWin may trigger

10. Very important for debug - implement file logging and log errors

11. check partitioned files unit tests coverage
