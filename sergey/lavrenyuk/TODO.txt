1. add javadocs

2. add project description to README file

3. implement code to examine survivals file (e.g. show win ratio) and decide what survivors should go to a final file to be
        used in fighting mode

4. implement fighting mode (? use different name ?)

5. survivors file is used as a backup file, but there is no option to recreate a population basing on survivors file,
        but only on scored weight matrices
        UPD there is an indirect way to do that - copy survivors and use  as scored weight matrices file,
            but that won't work if number of survivors in the file is less than 'survivors' config property

6. Document list of Robocode bugfeatures:
    (1) empty file created if not found
    (2) OnRoundEnded not triggered on exception, presumably both OnDeath and OnWin may trigger

7. check PartitionedFiles and Exceptions unit tests coverage
